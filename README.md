For wallpaper management: Using "AWWW Switcher" from [vicinae](https://github.com/vicinaehq/vicinae) extension store. For this to work, `awww-daemon` must be running. This is setup for auto-exec in my hyprland.conf. Install from AUR with `yay -S awww-git`

> [!NOTE]
> if you're using awww, disable hyprpaper.
